## Hi there, I am Luca Di Cola! 👋

I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Statistician, and a former start-up founder. I specialise in machine learning, predictive analytics, databases, and visualisations. I love to share results with stakeholders, to do presentations, and to use data to understand what is best for both the customer and the organisation.

## 👨‍💻 Professional Experience

- **Data Science Intern** at Cognosco Lab (Feb 2025 – June 2025)  
  *Integrated data science and cognitive science methodologies to examine the cognitive structures that underpin language and meaning in both humans and large language models (LLMs). Developed advanced beta regression models and leveraged hypergraph networks to uncover complex relationships within linguistic data. Utilised Python libraries such as HyperNetX, Matplotlib, Itertools, Pandas, and NumPy, alongside R packages including dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, caret, reshape2, purrr, performance, and betareg. The project was supported by a suite of technologies, including GitHub for version control, VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks for development, RStudio for statistical analysis, and Overleaf for collaborative documentation.*

- **Statistician Intern** at National Research Council (June 2023 - Sep 2023)
  *Developed Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) to predict the effects of fishing policies on prawn populations, integrating time series data and mixed-type variables for comprehensive analysis. Employed R libraries such as caret, gam, ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr to facilitate model building, data manipulation, and visualisation. The workflow was managed using GitHub for version control and RStudio for statistical computing and development.*

- **Statistician Intern** at Istituto Fondazione Carlo Cattaneo (June 2022 - Sep 2022)
  *Developed and constructed a comprehensive historical dataset on Italian funeral agencies spanning the 1920s to the 1970s, utilising archival sources. Ensured consistency and comparability across decades and regions by applying advanced Excel formulas, filters, and pivot tables to standardise the data.*
